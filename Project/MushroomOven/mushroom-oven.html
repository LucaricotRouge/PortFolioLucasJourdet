            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>As part of my innovation project in my first year of my Masters, I decided to do a resilient future project. 
                My idea was to make a pizza oven entirely out of mycelium composite that could work in a high temperature environment 
                of around 200°C. The choice of mycelium was made mainly for its advantages of lightness and thermal insulation. 
                However, as a bio-material, exposure to high temperatures can lead to deformation of its structure and 
                fire resistance. This is why I have used two protocols that I combined to reinforce the fire resistance and 
                thermal stability of the mycelium composite in the inner layer of the oven that will be directly exposed to 
                the heat source. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-14806-6" class="importantLink">The first protocol</a> enables fireproof mycelium to be grown directly by integrating 
                silicon directly into the internal structure of the fungal fibres as they grow. 
                <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0141391023001714?casa_token=%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20jH15BQBFrYMAAAAA:OSSES2ZWdQqA9ojSkBoWsrm8gg_qf4eNIkrwz21Cn_ULL5Y4Ah5TZdZp2f1bvkyR43Det2koSCXc" class="importantLink">The second protocol</a>
                uses glass microspheres and a deacetylation process to enhance the thermal stability and 
                fire resistance of the mycelium. However the desacetylation process was abandoned due to the fact that it reduces 
                the mechanical properties of the mycelium's composite. Knowing that hollow glass microspheres are also composed by 
                silicon I actually integrated only this element into the mycelium composite during the growing process.
                The oven had a spherical shape to allow a homogeneous heat distribution,and the design was inspired by the 
                HyphaL mycelium enclosure, winner of the 2024 green concept award.</p>
            
            <h2>Building The Oven Support</h2>
            <p>The oven support was made using steel bars that I <a class="importantContent">welded together</a> : </p>
            <div class="OvenSupport">

            </div>
            
            <h2>The Oven's Core</h2>

            <p>Creating a hollow sphere made of mycelium with an internal diameter of 60 cm and a thickness of 10 cm is no 
                easy task. The only molds available were hemispheres with diameters of 60 cm or 20 cm. The latter was too 
                small for a full-size oven, so I used the former. To achieve the approximate thickness of 10 cm, I placed 
                the mycelium composite on top of the half-sphere and measured the thickness at several points on the 
                half-sphere. The <a class="importantContent">hollow glass microspheres</a> were integrated into the mycelium composite. The mycelium 
                composite was also composed of <a class="importantContent">wood chip substrates and mycelium spores</a>. Once this substrate was placed on 
                top of the mold, I covered it with plastic film with holes punched in it to retain moisture and allow the 
                mycelium to “breathe.” After a few days of growth and drying in the open air, I <a class="importantContent">glued</a> the two hemispheres 
                together with mycelium composite, which developed and stuck the two hemispheres together to form... a sphere?
                In fact, the sphere was not as spherical as I would have liked, but this was due to two main reasons: the 
                lack of a reliable mold for a hollow sphere of this size and the shrinkage of the mycelium during drying.

            <h2>Electronic Part</h2>
            <p>The electronic part of the oven consists of a heating element, a fan to circulate the hot air inside the oven, 
                an Solid State Relay to power the heating module and a temperature sensor to monitor the internal temperature 
                of the oven. All those components were controled with an ESP32 microcontroller and a tiny display was used
                to show the temperature.

            <h2>Final Assembly</h2>
            <p>Once the support, the electronic part and the oven's core were ready, I assembled everything together. 
                I cut an opening in the mycelium sphere to insert the heating element, the fan and the temperature sensor. 
                The heating element and the fan where mounted on a mdf support because I lacked of aluminum plate to design the heating module.

            <h2>Test</h2>
            <p>
                For safety reasons, I performed my test with a temperature of <a class="importantContent">80°C</a> to heat some nuggets and it worked well !
