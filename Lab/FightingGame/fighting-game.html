            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This project was done during a computer science workshop. I had 3 days to learn how to connect and 
                make synchronized communication between two ESP32s to play a 1v1 fighting game with another local 
                player. With one of my classmates, we decided to make a game inspired by Street Fighter. </p>
            <p>We first designed two pixel art characters, each with four different frames of moves : </p>
            <img src="FightingGameCaractersFrames.png" alt="Frames of pixel art characters for the fighting game">
            <p>We first tried to display the characters on the 128x64 screen and make them move when pressing a 
                button. Initially, we wanted to control the characters' movements with a joystick, but we couldn't 
                display it correctly. So, we decided to focus solely on the attacking mechanics by only using a 
                button.</p>

            <h2>The Gameplay</h2>
            <p>
                Then, we used <span class="importantContent">WebSocket</span> to connect both boards by creating a server on my classmate's board and 
                connecting my board to it. We successfully created a mini-game with the two boards, where the 
                objective was to press the button as fast as possible until the opponent lost all their life points 
                to win. However, we couldn't implement the character animations in the game, which was a bit 
                disappointing.
