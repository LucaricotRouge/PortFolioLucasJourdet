                <div class="RythmGameImgAndText">
                    <p>This project is a rhythm game developed in Python using the <span class ="importantContent">Pygame</span>
                        library. The game lets players create a character by choosing a male or female character and entering his or her 
                        name. You can then select one of the characters created in the player section and press 
                        start to launch the game. During the game, the program allows you to save your score and 
                        accuracy in an Excel file at the end of each game. Game statistics are graphically 
                        displayed using <span class ="importantContent">Jupyter Notebook</span>, and the player also has access to a leaderboard in the 
                        character selection menu to view the current <span class="importantContent">ranking</span> (it resets when the program is closed, 
                        but is maintained as long as it is open, even if several games are run). For ease of use, 
                        misses are not counted when pigs leave the screen, but only when the player presses space at 
                        the wrong time as the pig approaches the character's hitbox. The intuition for a perfect 
                        score is as follows: press space when the pig's nose is above the character's yellow ball. 
                        The pause menu appears when you press the <span class="importantContent">“P”</span> key on the keyboard. The player has a total of 
                        3 lives before beeing turned into a pig by the evil pig curse...
