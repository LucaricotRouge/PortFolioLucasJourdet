            <div class="BiohybridSensorsImgAndText">
                <p>Based on the work of Nicolae et al."Biohybrid Devices" I replicate the "grow arround method" and "layering" 
                to embed sensing capabilities in bacterial cellullose. In the course of this project I built a total of 3 
                different sensors, two of which were resistive (temperature and stretch sensors) and one capacitive 
                (mutual capacitance matrix). Using the Arduino and other electronic components, I was able to design 
                functional bio-hybrid sensors.</p>

                    <h3 class="importantContent">How to create the temperature sensor :</h3>
                    <p>To make this sensor I used a <span class="importantContent">layering technique</span> as presented in the paper. A thin copper wire was 
                        inserted into a scoby cut in half to give the sensor its resistive properties. To dry the bacterial 
                        cellulose, the scoby/copper wire assembly was placed in the oven for a few hours.</p>
                    <h3 class="importantContent">Calibration :</h3>
                    <p>To make the sensor functional I used the simple principle of <span class="importantContent">TCR</span> (temperature coefficient of 
                        resistance) applied to copper wire and measured its slight variations in resistance due to a change 
                        in temperature. To do this I combined the temperature sensor with a <span class="importantContent">Wheatstone bridge</span> and an <span class="importantContent">HX711</span>, 
                        which I will calibrate to better display the temperature in the Arduino's serial monitor. The HX711 
                        is mainly used to amplify the voltage variation detected at the terminal of the Wheatstone bridge. 
                        The calibration of the HX711 was done through experimental measurements at controlled temperature. 
                        To measure and display correct temperatures on the Arduino's serial port, I determined a temperature 
                        equation as a function of the voltage at the terminal of the Wheatstone bridge, which I then 
                        implemented in the Arduino code.

                        conductive thread was placed in a mold and the scoby was allowed to grow around it for several days. 
                        Once the growth was complete, the sensor was removed from the mold and dried in an oven for a few hours.

                        <p>To make the sensor functional I used the principle of <span class="importantContent">piezoresistivity</span>, which consists in measuring 
                            the variation of resistance of the sensor when it is stretched. To do this I combined the stretch 
                            sensor with a <span class="importantContent">Wheatstone bridge</span> and an <span class="importantContent">HX711</span>, which I calibrated to better display the 
                            elongation in the Arduino's serial monitor. The calibration of the HX711 was done through 
                            experimental measurements at controlled elongations. To measure and display correct elongations on 
                            the Arduino's serial port, I determined an elongation equation as a function of the voltage at the 
                            terminal of the Wheatstone bridge, which I then implemented in the Arduino code.

                        <h3 class="importantContent">How to create the mutual capacitance sensor :</h3>
                        <p>For this sensor I used an Arduino, a <a href="https://github.com/muca-board/Muca?tab=readme-ov-file" class="importantLink">Muca</a>
                            sensor and the mutual capacitance matrix. 
                            To make it, I've used conductive yarn, a layering support and a scoby. The layering 
                            technique was used to make this sensor. The drying process is the same as for the other 
                            sensors. The soldering part is a bit tricky and we first had to remove some of the wire's 
                            protective insulation at the end with a soldering iron, put some extinguishant on it and 
                            solder it with a bad pin before reinforcing the whole thing with a sheath. As far as the 
                            Muca board is concerned, I downloaded the Muca library from <a href="https://github.com/muca-board/Muca?tab=readme-ov-file" class="importantLink">GitHub</a>
                            and used the relevant functions to retrieve the useful data (getTouch() in particular, which provides the touch 
                            coordinates and weight). To make the visualisation of the touch more intuitive and visible, 
                            I created a display in Processing by treating the data returned on the Arduino's serial 
                            port. Unfortunately, the sensor contains a faulty row and column that distort the display 
                            on these axes (axes in red).</p>
