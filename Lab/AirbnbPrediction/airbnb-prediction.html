                    <p>The aim of this project is to predict the rental price of an Airbnb based on a set of 
                        characteristics. A large part of the work was to convert the textual characteristics into 
                        information that can be used by a machine learning algorithm.</p>

                    An initial sort was carried out on features that were difficult to process, such as unique 
                    values like ‘id’, ‘name’, ‘unnamed: 0’, and ‘description’. Boolean features 
                    (‘cleaning_fee’, ‘host_has_profile_pic’, ‘host_identity_verified’, and ‘instant_bookable’) 
                    were replaced by 0s or 1s, ‘first_review’ and ‘last_review’ by the number of days since the 
                    first and last evaluations (the same principle was applied to the ‘host_since’ feature). Nan' 
                    in “host_response_rate” have been replaced by 0 and percentages by decimal numbers between 0 
                    and 1, “cancelation_policy” values by an ordinal encoding with 0 to 4 depending on whether the 
                    variable takes the value “flexible”, “moderate”, “strict”, “super_strict_30” or 
                    “super_strict_60”, “amenities” by the number of elements it contains, property_type', 
                    “room_type”, and “bed_type” by associating a particular number with each type of distinct 
                    element in one of these characteristics, and finally as far as the “city” characteristic is 
                    concerned I've also encoded it after giving a visualisation of the regions according to 
                    longitude and latitude coordinates.

                <p>
                    To simplify the data even further without losing a significant amount of information, 
                    I had to carry out a PCA. However, the results of the PCA didn't give me any interesting 
                    results in terms of simplifying the model without any significant loss of information. 
                    This is why I directly deleted certain characteristics after analysing a correlation matrix

                        <div class="AirbnbPredictionImgAndText4">
                    <p>Having sorted the data and identified the relevant features, all that remained was to 
                        separate Data_AirbnbTrain into two variables X and y, where y contains 'log_price' and X 
                        the other features. In a first test, 3 models were tested: linear regression, decision 
                        trees and random forest. The results showed problems of high bias and low variance. I 
                        decided to carry out a second test on these 3 models, solving these problems. To improve 
                        our models, it is possible to increase the number of features to make the model more 
                        complex (this can be done by re-training the model with DataAirbnb_Train, which contains 
                        many more features), but also to decrease the regularization of our model.</p>
